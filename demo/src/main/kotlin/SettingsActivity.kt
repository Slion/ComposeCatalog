/**
 * A second settings host: a dedicated activity running its own
 * [net.slions.compose.toolkit.Catalog] that contains only the theme page.
 *
 * This exists to demonstrate that one app can host **several independent Catalogs**. Each
 * [Catalog] builds its own [net.slions.compose.toolkit.SearchIndex] from its own page tree,
 * so the search field here covers only the theme page — a separate search scope from the
 * main activity's Catalog — while both Catalogs read and write the same process-wide
 * [net.slions.compose.toolkit.Store] (see [net.slions.compose.toolkit.createDefaultStore]):
 * a change made here is persisted and picked up by the main activity on return.
