/**
 * The root page of the sample tree, shared by every sample host (the full-screen screen
 * and the bottom sheet): a card group with one page row per item type (each exercising the
 * type's various configurations), the root's own preferences below them, and two action
 * rows at the end.
 *
 * The action rows carry an [item] action that replaces navigation — their trailing action
 * icon is the open-in-new (not the page-row chevron) accordingly: the Settings row opens
 * the theme in a separate activity hosting its own [net.slions.compose.toolkit.Catalog]
 * (its own page tree and a separate search scope, yet the same process-wide store), and
 * the Sheet row opens this very tree in a bottom sheet in the current activity. The live
 * "Theme" page is not part of this tree at all: it is hosted only by that activity.
 *
 * @param onOpenSettings Invoked when the Settings row is tapped, to start the settings
 *   activity.
 * @param onOpenSheet Invoked when the Sheet row is tapped, to show the bottom sheet.
