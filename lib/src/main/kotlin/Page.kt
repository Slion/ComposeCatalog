/**
 * A settings page: an id, a title, and its items.
 *
 * A page is just a collection of items: any of the library's `*Item` / `section` /
 * `card` builders, in any order, plus [item] rows with a [Page] that reference child
 * pages (the way a page opens its children). The tree can nest to any depth. An id
 * names a page: the same page may be hosted from several places in the tree (its rows
 * are aliases, and the page is indexed and searchable once), but two distinct pages
 * must have distinct ids (a collision is a programming error, checked when the tree is
 * walked).
 *
 * @property id Id of the page; it is used as the lazy list key and as the navigation
 * destination. The same id may appear in several places of the tree (the same page
 * hosted from several), but never names two different pages.
 * @property title Title of the page, shown in the list pane and in the detail top bar.
 * @property summary Optional summary shown below the title in the list pane.
 * @property icon Optional leading icon, shown to the left of the title in the list pane.
 * @property contentVersion Increment when the items [content] produces change at runtime
 * (items added or removed without a new [Page]) so the screen's search index is
 * rebuilt. It is declared before [content] so trailing-lambda call sites
 * (`Page(id, title) { ... }`) still bind their lambda to [content].
 * @property content The items of the page. It runs in a pane's lazy list scope, so it
 * cannot read the composition directly: capture any theme values (e.g.
 * `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`) in an enclosing `@Composable` scope before building the
 * page.
