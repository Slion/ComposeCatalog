 *   pane; the top bar shows the page title with a back arrow, and system back pops the
 *   detail before dismissing the screen.
 * - Two-pane (e.g. wide windows): both panes are visible at once; the top bar shows the
 *   screen title and there is no navigation.
 *
 * The list pane shows the root page's items (its sub-page rows and its regular items, in
 * content order); the detail pane shows the selected page's items the same way. The list
 * pane shows an MD3-style search pill; while a query is entered, the items are replaced
 * by the matching pages and preference entries, and selecting a result clears the query
 * and opens the page (or scrolls the list to the entry's row).
 *
 * @param title Title of the screen, shown in the top bar.
 * @param root The root page: its items are the list pane's top level, and its page rows
 *   ([item] with a [Page]) are the first-level pages. A page whose row carries an
 *   [item] action is an action row, not a viewable page: the two-pane auto-open skips
 *   it.
 * @param modifier Modifier applied to the root surface.
 * @param onBack Called when the host should dismiss the screen (i.e. system back while
 * the list pane is on screen in a single-pane layout, or a tap of the title-bar back
 * button when [showBackButton] is on and the tree is at its root).
 * @param backEnabled Whether the screen's system-back handling is active. A host that
 * covers the screen with its own layer (e.g. a fragment or view shown over it) passes
 * false so that back goes to that layer — and its back stack — first.
 * @param showBackButton Whether to show a back chevron next to the screen title (the
 * single-pane title bar and, in two-pane, the breadcrumb). Nested in the tree it pops
 * one level up, as the existing chevron does; at the root it calls [onBack]. A host
 * that is not the app's root surface (e.g. an activity opened from another screen)
 * sets this — with [onBack] closing the host — so the user can return without hunting
 * the system back.
 * @param adaptiveInfo Adaptive layout info computed for the host of the screen instead
 * of for the window. The screen's adaptive layout (single- vs two-pane) follows this
 * value, which is what a host smaller than the window — e.g. a modal bottom sheet, a
 * dialog, or a split — passes: it measures its own size and builds a
 * [WindowAdaptiveInfo] for it (with no hinges, since the fold does not apply to the
 * host), so the screen adapts to the host rather than to the window. Null (the default)
 * uses the window.
 * @param singlePaneOnly Forces the single-pane layout regardless of the (host) width, so
 * a host that must never split into a list + detail (e.g. a bottom sheet, a dialog)
 * stays single-pane even when it is wide; the list navigates to the detail and back.
 * @param options Tunables for the fold/adaptive workarounds (hinge policy, two-pane
 * width class, pane fading edges); see [CatalogOptions].
